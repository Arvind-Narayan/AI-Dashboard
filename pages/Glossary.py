st.subheader('What is the Adobe Digital Price Index?')
st.write(''' The Adobe Digital Price Index (DPI) is a comprehensive measure of inflation in the digital economy, developed by Adobe in partnership with renowned economists. The key points about the Adobe Digital Price Index are:
- It is modeled after the Consumer Price Index (CPI) published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, but focuses specifically on tracking online prices rather than offline prices.
- It analyzes over one trillion visits to retail sites and over 100 million product SKUs across 18 different product categories, including electronics, apparel, groceries, and more.
- The index uses the Fisher Price Index methodology to calculate price changes by category, weighting the analysis by the actual quantities of products purchased in adjacent months.
- The DPI is developed in partnership with renowned economists Austan Goolsbee and Pete Klenow, providing expert economic insights.
- It provides the most comprehensive view into how much consumers pay for goods online, complementing the government's CPI which captures offline prices.
         
In summary, the Adobe Digital Price Index is a leading indicator of digital economy inflation, leveraging Adobe's extensive e-commerce data to deliver a more comprehensive and timely measure of online price trends compared to traditional government indexes.
